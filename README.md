# AI Accessories

**Cognitive Accessibility Tools for Humans**  

AI Accessories are tools that augment human cognition without replacing it.  
They are designed to be **removable, inspectable, and user-controlled**, providing support where humans need it most — reasoning, memory, language, planning — while respecting agency at all times.

## Manifesto (included)

**Preamble:**  
AI Accessories exist to **augment human cognition**, not replace it. They are tools, not agents, always subordinate to human judgment.

**Rules:**

1. **Assist, do not replace.** Enhance thinking, never supplant it.  
2. **Single declared purpose.** Each accessory has a clearly stated function.  
3. **Explainability required.** All reasoning, assumptions, and processes must be accessible on request.  
4. **User-owned configuration.** Preferences and settings are editable and controlled by the user.  
5. **Explicit memory only.** Memory is inspectable and discardable; no hidden belief formation.  
6. **Assumptions and limits disclosed.** Every accessory must state what it can and cannot do.  
7. **No identity simulation.** Accessories may not present themselves as the user or moral authority.  
8. **Removable without penalty.** Accessories can be disabled at any time.  
9. **Accessibility first.** Support neurodivergence, language differences, and cognitive variation.  
10. **Human agency is supreme.** Design decisions prioritize the user’s control and autonomy.

## How to Contribute

- Read the Manifesto before proposing anything.  
- Ensure all accessories respect the 10 rules.  
- Use clear, human-friendly language.  
- Accessibility is mandatory, not optional.

## Next Steps

1. RFC-0001: Formal definition of an AI Accessory  
2. RFC-0002: Accessory Interface Specification  
3. RFC-0003: Cognitive Config “Genome” Specification  
4. Build initial accessories: Reasoning Scaffold, Memory Brace, Language Lens

## Purpose

The goal is to create tools that **extend cognition safely**, especially for users with neurodivergence, cognitive processing differences, or accessibility needs.  
They help people **think, plan, communicate, and manage complexity** without taking over or replacing their thought processes.# MindKrutch-AI-
